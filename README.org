#+title: TEDxLight

Colorful jewlery project proposal for TEDxKrak√≥w.



* Directory structure

- tedx_master - prototype code for Stellaris Launchpad. Drives RGB
  diode through HSV color space with the use of a potentiometer. When
  two such circuits meet together (via two pins), they read the color
  value of their counterpart and both average their colors, thus both
  shining in the same way.

- tedx_slave - basically tedx_mater, but with hardcoded potentiometer
  value, because I didn't have another one lying around.
